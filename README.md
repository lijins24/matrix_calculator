\section*{Matrix Calculator}
\subsection*{What is it?}
Matrices have become a critical tool in various industries to perform a wide range of tasks in the modern era. They allow for the easy storage and manipulation of data in fields ranging from computer science and robotics to economics. Our objective with this Python package is to provide a streamlined and efficient tool for executing matrix operations for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices. This package includes a variety of functions, from basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction to more complex operations like transforming matrices into row echelon form.The final package will consist of a single class that takes the input of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix and executes the desired operation, with each operation being placed in its own individual function for efficient execution. The more complex functions will depend on the outputs of previous functions, creating a hierarchical structure.
\subsection*{Main Features}
\Flexible user input for any real numbers in the 2x2 or 3x3 matrix format\\
\Perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, and subtraction with high accuracy that are either 2x2 or 3x3\\
\Multiply 2x2 and 3x3 matrices, along with determining the transpose, inverse, and rank of the inputted matrices.\\
\Easily work with the matrices to determine if they are positive definite\\
Reorganize the inputted matrices into Row-Echelon form for simplified solvability in a system of equations
